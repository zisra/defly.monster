When using skin editor there is an option to replace game sprite. As you might know this changes the way thing like towers, bullets, ffa bots! and ... will look.
When attempting to replace game sprite, one might note that there are a lot of options, which might be confusing.
Here we try to make a guide about that. There is lot to be done so any information you have regarding the sprites is appreciated.

For each sprite we are looking for Four properties:

- What they do.
- In which settings they do that (game mode, colorblind mode, dark theme or light theme, ...)
- Scaling Ratio; As you might know, the game scales the same PNG file for different sprites differently so this is very important to know. I usually test with a 256x256 PNG and check for the results.
- Tint or no tint
